LNG302   Interpersonal Communication   in the Workplace
Semester 2, 2023-2024
Written Analysis of CommunicationWith   reference to the readings   provided, as well as   lectures and workshops   in   Weeks   1 through to Week   6   of the   module,   analyse the   piece   of   communication   provided   to   you via   email   as   a transcript. with the   aid of   so-called   “face   theory”   .   For   the   purposes   of this assignment,      “face    theory” is inclusive of    “politeness      theory” and      “face   constitution theory”, in addition to Goffman’s work as found in Interaction Ritual. In this   assignment, “Face theory” can also be treated as an extension of “speech act theory”   .   The analysis should   be set out   as   a   report   under the   following   headings   and   address   the issues corresponding to these headings. Refer to the line numbers on the   transcript. when   citing   examples. There   is   no   need to   reproduce   large amounts of the   transcript. apart from quotations that effectively illustrate your analysis.
IntroductionOutline the structure of the report and highlight any theoretical or analytical issues you   would   like   to   draw   to   the    reader’s   attention    in   particular.   These   are   issues   to   be   addressed   in detail in the remaining   sections   of the   report.
Preliminary ObservationsHighlight the preliminary observations you   made on the interaction. This may   include,   but is not limited to, commenting on the   possible   topic(s) of the meeting, the   participants,   the   timing,   and   other   relevant   aspects   of   the   situation.   Briefly   indicate   which   parts   of   the   transcript   helped   you   make   these   observations   and   those   which   may   bring these very observations   into question.
Analysis
With   reference   to   theoretical   material   concerning   “face   theory”,   and   based   firmly   on   your analysis of the text provided, address such questions   as   the   ones   below:
●         What did each of the speakers   think   about:
o   The situation they were   in?
o   Each other?
o   Themselves?
●       What did the   speakers   make   of the   impression   others   may   have   had   of them?
●         How did the speakers’ evaluations of any of the above   change   over the   course   of the   meeting?   How   were   these   changes   expressed   in   their   verbal   and   non-   verbal behaviour?
●         How   were   these   changes   noticed   by   some   speakers   in   different   ways   and   to   the different degrees and at different   p代 写LNG302 Interpersonal Communication in the Workplace Semester 2, 2023-2024

●         Relative   to   their respective expectations and goals, how did the speakers   compare   in terms of their performance in the   meeting?
Questions   Remaining on the   InteractionDiscuss what questions could still   be asked of the interaction.   In   other words,   discuss   what   things   remain   uncertain   despite   the   analysis   reported   above.   Moreover,   what   problems   could   be   identified   with   “face   theory”   and   its   varieties   in   the   light   of   your   analysis? What suggestions can   be   made to develop   such   a   theory   further   to   explain   variations in interpersonal communication   in the workplace?
Concluding CommentsInclude a   brief summary of the   initial observations, analysis and questions   remaining.   You   may   also   wish   to   make   pertinent   additional   comments   which   do   not   belong   to   other sections as   such.

Grading CriteriaThe   usual   criteria   for   written   assignments   apply.   By   applying   these   criteria   to   this   assignment,   it would   be   possible   to   describe   the   quality   of very   good   reports   on   this   topic as compared to very   poorly written   reports on the same topic.
